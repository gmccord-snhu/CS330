# Designing Software

## How do I approach designing software?

For this project, I approached the design of the 3D scene by breaking the problem into modular components: object creation, texture application, lighting, camera controls, and scene rendering. Each element was designed iteratively, starting with basic shapes and gradually adding complexity, such as textures and lighting, to match the client's vision. The goal was to ensure that the final scene was scalable, maintainable, and polished.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project enhanced my ability to think in terms of 3D geometry and spatial relationships. Specifically, I refined my understanding of how to represent real-world objects with simple geometric shapes and how to combine them into more complex structures. I also gained experience with the lighting and texturing aspects of 3D modeling, which is crucial in making the scene visually compelling.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?

1. **Research & Prototyping**: I began by prototyping objects in 3D space with various meshes, experimenting with texture and light to see if the effect I wanted was rendered. The objects which turned out well, I kept and those which were too complex or did not render well enough I discarded.
2. **Object Creation & Texturing**: I started by modeling low-polygon objects using basic shapes, followed by applying textures that best fit each object’s appearance. At first, I used common sample textures for all of it, earmarking places where real textures would be placed. I didn't want to spend too much time hunting for the right texture at this time. Thus, at this phase, many 'placeholder' textures were used.
3. **Lighting & Scene Layout**: I then set up the lighting sources and adjusted the object positions relative to each other to match the image. Adding small white cubes for debugging light sources was immensely helpful understanding the position of light sources. Without these cubes, I was just guessing.
4. **Camera Navigation & Interaction**: Once the scene was created, I focused on implementing camera controls, ensuring that users could navigate and explore the scene with ease.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The modular design approach I followed will be invaluable in future 3D or game development projects. By focusing on breaking tasks into smaller, manageable components (like object creation, texturing, lighting, and camera controls), I can ensure that future projects are scalable, maintainable, and easy to test.

# 2. Developing Programs

## How do I approach developing programs?

I developed the program by starting with the core OpenGL rendering functions and then added features step by step. I implemented the basic 3D rendering pipeline first, followed by adding object models, texturing, lighting, and interactive camera controls. Each step was tested thoroughly before moving to the next feature to ensure the system was functioning properly.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

This project involved several new development strategies, such as using the Phong shading model for realistic lighting, implementing camera movement for navigation, and using multiple light sources to create depth and realism. I also employed efficient 3D transformations to correctly position and orient objects in space. Additionally, I learned how to manage camera views between perspective and orthographic modes, improving the visualization of the scene.

## How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration played a significant role in the development process. After completing each feature (e.g., object creation, texture mapping, lighting), I would test and refine the implementation. For example, when working with the camera controls, I iterated through different configurations of keyboard and mouse inputs to provide smooth and intuitive navigation. This iterative approach allowed for continuous improvement and fine-tuning of the scene.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

Initially, I focused more on creating simple 3D shapes and getting the basic OpenGL setup right. As I progressed through the milestones, I started integrating more complex features like lighting, textures, and camera controls. My coding approach evolved from focusing on individual components to considering how they interact together in the final scene, which improved my ability to build coherent and polished 3D environments.

# How Can Computer Science Help Me Reach My Goals?

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Working on this project deepened my understanding of computational graphics, particularly in how algorithms and mathematics are applied in 3D rendering and modeling. It also exposed me to essential tools and libraries, such as OpenGL, which are commonly used in fields like computer graphics, gaming, and simulation. These skills will be crucial as I move forward in my education, especially in courses related to computer graphics, game development, or simulation technologies.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

The knowledge gained from this project is directly applicable to roles in game development, CGI, and 3D visualization. As a professional, the ability to create, manipulate, and render 3D objects is a valuable skill in industries like gaming, virtual reality, medical visualization, and architectural design. Additionally, this project provided insight into working with shaders, lighting, and camera systems—skills that are highly sought after in 3D graphics programming positions.
